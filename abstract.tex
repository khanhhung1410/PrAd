\section*{Abstract}
Smart phones and mobile devices have become more and more ubiquitous recently. This ubiquity gives chance for mobile advertising, especially location-based advertising, to develop into a very promising market. With many location-based advertising services, it is implied that service providers obtain actual locations of users so that relevant advertisements, which are near users' current locations, can be served to them. However, this practice has raised a  significant privacy concern as various private information of a user can be inferred based on her locations and trajectories. In this work, we propose \codename, a location based advertising model that appreciates users' location privacy; i.e. never reveals their locations to any untrusted party. \codename is conceptualized based on several state-of-the-art privacy preserving techniques such as \textit{data obfuscation}, \textit{space encoding} and \textit{private information retrieval}. Moreover, \codename enables a correct billing mechanism among involved parties without revealing any individual sensitive information. We confirm the effectiveness of our proposed framework by evaluating its performance using real-world datasets.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a location privacy aware LBA framework \codename. By utilizing several state-of-the-art techniques in addressing privacy issues such as space-encoding, private information retrieval, homomorphic encryption, our framework can enable the LBAS to serve clients with location-based advertisements without compromising users' location privacy. We intuitively prove the security of our system and evaluate its performance using real-world data set. We claim that our framework is scalable and very practical. As future work, we aim to further develop \codename to support personalized LBA.
